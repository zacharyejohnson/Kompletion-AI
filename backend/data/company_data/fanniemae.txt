Fannie Mae provides lenders with a reliable source of mortgage financing
Since 1938, Fannie Mae has provided a reliable source of affordable mortgage financing across the country. We support renters, homebuyers, and homeowners by creating solutions that expand access to affordable housing opportunities. We do not originate loans or lend money directly to borrowers. Instead, we acquire mortgage loans made by lenders and then issue guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by those loans that attract investors. In 2022, Fannie Mae enabled the financing of approximately 2.6 million home purchases, refinancings, and rental units.

We create opportunities to rent, buy, and refinance
Our work benefits the housing market in several key ways:

We increase housing affordability by offering programs, products, and tools to help make housing more accessible.
We support housing stability by providing homeowners and renters with education — including foreclosure prevention options — and by maintaining sustainable, inclusive credit standards. 
We enable additional liquidity for mortgage lending, which helps expand access to affordable housing.
 

We work to reduce barriers and expand access
Fannie Mae’s mission is to facilitate equitable and sustainable access to homeownership and quality, affordable rental housing across America. We continue to address the inequities of the past and are working to reduce the housing gaps that exist for members of underserved communities. Fannie Mae also provides reliable information to educate and empower renters and homeowners in their housing decisions.
